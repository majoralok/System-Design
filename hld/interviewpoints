If you want to get better at System Design interviews, remember these 24 principles:


✅ If you need to scale an individual component, stick with Vertical Scaling first. Then, look at Horizontal Scaling when needed 

✅ To deal with traffic spikes, evaluate the use of Autoscaling for Dynamic Resource Allocation 

✅ If the system requires High Availability with Performance, consider using a Load Balancer 

✅ If you’re building a read-heavy system, it’s a good idea to use a Cache 

✅ Listen to the system requirements properly and note them down if needed 

✅ To reduce the latency of static assets, consider using a CDN 

✅ If you want to improve the database query performance, focus on the right indexes 

✅ To scale the read requests to your database, consider Database Replication 

✅ To scale write requests, consider Database Sharding 

✅ Clarify your assumptions before jumping into the solution 

✅ For global distribution of data, use a CDN 

✅ If you want to store complex data such as videos, images and files, go for an Object Storage 

✅ To manage the load on the server and prevent denial-of-service attacks, use Rate Limiting 

✅ In order to remove a Single Point of Failure, implement Redundancy and Isolation 

✅ Clarify about the Non-Functional Requirements as well and take them into account 

✅ To improve the Fault Tolerance and Durability of your data, consider Data Replication techniques 

✅ If the system needs to execute long-running tasks, use Async Processing and Background Processes 

✅ To build a loosely coupled system, consider the use of Event-Driven Architecture 

✅ If the system needs to store unstructured data, consider NoSQL databases 

✅ Keep getting feedback during the discussion rather than waiting till the end 

✅ To deal with large amounts of data flowing through the network, use Compression and Pagination techniques 

✅ For automated builds and deployments, consider implementing CI/CD pipelines 

✅ If you want to achieve independent deployments of various parts of the system, consider microservices architecture 

✅ Establish good eye contact with the interviewer and answer the questions confidently.
