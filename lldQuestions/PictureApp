Build an application that allows users to post pictures and like pictures posted by others on it.
Users may also follow other users.
 
Functionalities required:
A new user should be able to register to the application.
A user should be able to post a picture with a caption. For simplicity, consider the picture 
as a string value
A user should be able to Follow/UnFollow any number of other users of their choice. UnFollow operation is supposed to reverse the Follow operation.
A user should be able to Like/UnLike any number of pictures posted by others. UnLike operation is supposed to reverse the Like operation.
Any user should be able to see posted pictures by everyone on the app. Pictures should be sorted by created time. (Last created should come first)
Show the number of likes on a picture at any point of time.
Show list of followers of a user at any point of time.
Example:
Sample Data:
RegisterUser(User1, UserName1); - Register User1
Post(User1, Picture1, caption1); - User1 posts Picture1, caption1
Post(User1, Picture2, caption2); - User1 posts Picture2, caption2
RegisterUser(User2, UserName2); - Register User2
Like(User2, Picture1); - User2 likes Picture1 
Follow(User2, User1); - User2 follows User1
RegisterUser(User3, UserName3); - Register User3
Post(User3, Picture3, caption3); - User3 posts Picture3, caption3
RegisterUser(User4, UserName4); - Register User4
RegisterUser(User5, UserName5); - Register User5
Follow(User4, User1); - User4 follows User1
Follow(User5, User1); - User5 follows User1
 
Case 1:
Input - showPictures
Output - [Picture3,Picture2,Picture1]
 
Case 2:
Input - getLikes(Picture1)
Output - 1
 
Case 3:
Input - getFollowers(User1)
Output - [User2,User4,User5]
 
 
 
Bonus:
Promote a user to star user if he has more than x followers(For below example x = 2). Get star users
Show list of users the particular user follows.
Show pictures of only those users whom I follow. If I donâ€™t follow any user, result should be empty
 
Case 1:
Input - showPictures(User2);
Output - [Picture2, Picture1]; - Picture3 won't appear because User2 follows User1 and not User3
 
Case 2:
Input - getMyFollowers(User2);
Output -  [User1]
 
Case 3:
Input - getStarUsers();
Output -  [User1]
